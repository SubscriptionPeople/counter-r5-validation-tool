COUNTER provides the Code of Practice that enables publishers and vendors to report usage of their electronic resources in a consistent way. This enables libraries to compare data received from different publishers and vendors.

COUNTER maintains the Registries of Compliance that lists the publishers and vendors who have passed an independent audit of their usage statistics. The registry also includes details of the content provider’s SUSHI implementation.

COUNTER also provides advice and guidance to those implementing and using COUNTER statistics and it supports the Usus website, an independent community website for those interested in usage statistics”
